# Hotel-Cancellation-Analysis

# Project Summary
# Business Question
In this project, I tackle the critical question of how to effectively predict hotel booking cancellations. The ability to predict cancellations can provide significant operational and strategic advantages to hotel businesses. It impacts revenue management, inventory distribution, customer relationship handling, and service personalization. Understanding the factors that contribute to cancellations allows hotels to implement preventive measures, optimize occupancy rates, and enhance customer satisfaction.

# Why This Matters
The hospitality industry operates on thin margins, and every booking is an opportunity to generate revenue. Cancellations can lead to unoccupied rooms, which are a direct loss of potential earnings. By forecasting cancellations accurately, hotels can mitigate financial risks, optimize pricing strategies, and reallocate resources more efficiently. This project aims to aid hoteliers in taking proactive steps towards a more robust and dynamic booking management system.

# Data Analysis
# Data Collection
I utilized the Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, which is an aggregation of genuine booking records from Resort and City hotels. The dataset contains 119,390 observations and 32 variables that capture various aspects of the booking process, customer demographics, and transaction details.

# Methodology
My methodology consisted of three main phases:

1. Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I began with thorough data cleaning to handle missing values,  and errors. Following this, I conducted EDA to uncover underlying patterns, trends, and correlations within the data that could influence cancellations.
2. Feature Engineering and Selection: Through our analysis, I identified several key attributes that potentially affect booking cancellations. These attributes were classified into categories such as Guest Preferences, Marketing & Sales, Demographics, Historic, Operational, and Booking Outcomes.
3. Predictive Modeling:I developed and refined various algorithms to create predictive models, comparing their performances to select the best model for real-time cancellation prediction.

# Data Visualization
To better interpret and communicate the findings, a range of visualizations were developed:
1. Heat Maps: To illustrate the correlation between different features and cancellations.
2. Time Series Analysis: To show booking and cancellation trends over time.
3. Pie Charts , Bar Graphs and Others: For demographic , categorical data analysis, feature importance and patterns analysis.
4. Confusion Matrix Graph: To evaluate model performance metrics visually.  
   
These visualizations were instrumental in providing insights into the data and the efficacy of the predictive models.

# Strategic Implementation
I recommended the following strategies:
1. Dynamic Pricing Model: Utilizing the predictive insights to adjust prices in response to cancellation risks.
2. Customer Engagement Tactics: Tailoring marketing and communication efforts based on customer profiles to reduce potential cancellations.
3. Overbooking Policy: Developing a sophisticated overbooking approach that factors in the predicted cancellation rates, thus maximizing room occupancy and revenue.
4. Personalized Experience Offers: Creating customized offers for guests with a high risk of cancellation to incentivize them to follow through with their bookings.

# Conclusion
Through the combination of predictive analytics and strategic implementation, this work sets a new benchmark for managing hotel operations with an eye towards maximizing revenue and enhancing customer satisfaction.
